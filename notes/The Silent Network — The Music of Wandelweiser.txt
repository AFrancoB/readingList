Notes:

This essay examines Wandelweiser as a unique social and artistic formation while
considering the social import of the group’s artistic works. Tracing Wandelweiser’s
history and analyzing a selection of its musical works, the group is considered in relation
to historical avant-garde movements and contemporary network theory. Though lacking
an official manifesto, Wandelweiser’s aesthetic program can be located largely in its
interpretations of John Cage’s silent composition 4 0 33 00 . Expressed in the various
interviews, writings, and musical works of Wandelweiser members, these readings of
Cage’s work—largely consonant with the consideration of ‘silence as an autonomous
musical phenomenon’—are contrasted with existing and original interpretations of 4 0 33 00
which underline its potential as a conceptual, discursive, and socially engaged musical
work.
