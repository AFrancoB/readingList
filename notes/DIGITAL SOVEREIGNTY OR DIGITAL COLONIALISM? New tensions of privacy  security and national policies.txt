Notes:

Beyond tensions of privacy and security, we are witnessing today a real confrontation between control and freedom, not only of the individual, but of entire populations and regions, enhanced by technologies and massive collection and analysis of data – from predicting and influencing behaviours,  to  the  automation  of  public  services  and  the  ability  to  fully  control  and  disrupt  those  services,  even  remotely.  From  gaining  access  to  a  global  communications  platform  to  losing the ability to protect the rights of those who are interconnected through those platforms. Are we witnessing a new form of digital colonialism? This  article  focuses  on  regional,  national,  and  community  solutions  to  restore  control  and  ownership  on  key  information  and  communications  infrastructures  –  the  only  possible  first step  to  fix  the  current  massive  violation  of  privacy  rights.  It  will  later  suggest  some  local measures to experiment with and advance alternatives at different levels of intervention and action, including proactive policy, capacity building, and new designs inspired in a set of values and principles different from those of the dominant actors in the market
