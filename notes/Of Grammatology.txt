Derrida argues that throughout the Western philosophical tradition, writing has been considered as merely a derivative form of speech, and thus as a 'fall' from the 'full presence' of speech. In the course of the work he deconstructs this position as it appears in the work of several writers, showing the myriad aporias and ellipses to which this leads them. Derrida does not claim to be giving a critique of the work of these thinkers, because he does not believe it possible to escape from operating with such oppositions. Nevertheless, he calls for a new science of 'grammatology' that would relate to such questions in a new way.
