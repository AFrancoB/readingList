Notes:

The potential richness of audio technology on the internet
springs from advancements integral to developments driven by
the primary concerns of commerce and science, giving rise to
operable and affordable bandwidth in newly-accessible
geographical areas as well as the growing sophistication of
codecs, browser technology and audio frameworks. Yet use of
these tools remains unexplored for music performance, with the
primary cause of disruption to performance flows being
transmission latency. Through the employment of sophisticated
tools and processes, musicians may, however, learn to navigate
Networked Music systems as a native performance platform.
