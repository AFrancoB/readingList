Notes:

With the possible exception	of Franco Berardi, very little work has	been done in this area aside from the Promethean	utopianism of 90s libertarian cyber-­culture.	
Most contemporary research focuses solely on their notions of movement and networks. It’s important to remember that both Deleuze and Guattari’s writings on computers, digital telecommunication, media technologies	and the	Internet were always concerned first and foremost with issues concerning subjectivity,	 as such this is a modest attempt to synthesis an updated schizoanalytic understanding of digital space.

The concept of resistance has a	very particular use, meaning the resistance to a subject’s own microfascisms – the subtle drives to dominate and oppress.	
In this context resistance becomes generative of a certain type of subjectivity that I argue opens up an amazing capacity for radical social transformation.
