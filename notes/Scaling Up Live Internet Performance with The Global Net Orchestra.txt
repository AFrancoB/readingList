Notes:

Networked or “telematic” music performances take many
forms, ranging from small laptop ensembles using local
area networks to long-distance musical collaborations
using audio and video links. Two important concerns for
any networked performance are: (1) what is the role of
communication in the music performance? In particular,
what are the esthetic and pragmatic justifications for per-
forming music at a distance, and (2) how are the effects
of communication latency ameliorated or incorporated
into the performance? A recent project, the Global Net
Orchestra, is described. In addition to addressing these
two concerns, the technical aspects of the project, which
achieved a coordinated performance involving 68 com-
puter musicians, each with their own connection to the
network, are described.
