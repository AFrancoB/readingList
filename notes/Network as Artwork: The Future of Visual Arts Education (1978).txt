Notes:

Network as artwork. The future of visual arts education.

Post institutional context ***

"Each of these interconnected areas willbe approached by the student from the point of view of analysis,theory, speculation, or social application. Such implied access andinteraction will dissolve the fine art /applied design dichotomies andantipathies that currently exist at the professional level."

"Through travel and teleconferencing, students will access a globalindex of resources suited to their individual needs. This behaviorwill become the norm, attendance at the college with a 9:00 to 5:00schedule  of  classes  becoming  quite  redundant."
