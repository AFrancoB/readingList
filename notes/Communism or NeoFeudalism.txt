Notes:

This lecture looks at the neo-feudalizing tendencies in contemporary capitalism. Expropriation, domination, and force have intensified to such an extent that it no longer makes sense to posit free and equal actors meeting in the labor market even as a governing fiction. Rent and debt feature as or more heavily in accumulation than profit, and work increasingly exceeds the wage relation. The alternative to neo-feudalism is communism.
