Notes:


From Stephen Morton's reading on Spivak: The text is a broad criticism to 'benevolent white western' intellectuals that when representing the voice of emancipation struggles silence oppressed people aprticularly workers and people from the third world. Starts with Marx but it goes one to critique the positions of special cases; particularly post-modern philosophers as Foucault and Deleuze. A book in which the appropriation of the voice of the subalterns is discussed. Any form of academia is colonial insofar is observing a 'other' and 'take that from there to here'.

This problem is fundamental since the relationship between Deleuze and Zapatismo is going to be explored in depth for my project. 

Personal observations: 

Keep in mind that such movement of appropiation has to always work in the other direction: Take what is created and understood in the top spheres and socialise it in such a way that becomes accesible and useful for the many and, particularly, what Spivak describes as the 'subaltern'.

These directly speak to my positionality, the relationships being foregrounded in the Canada-Mexico relationship, in the whitexican-indigenous divide, the problems on mestizaje, etc.
