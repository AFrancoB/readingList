Notes:


Given the cultural differences between south (peasents) and north (proletariats) capital impedes alliances between subaltern groups. The North-south divide is recursive: it can be extrapolated to registers beyond the Italian nation (for example the industrious north in Mexico and the indigenous-central-american south or the barbaric mexico and the civilised US-Canada in North America).

How the question of subalternity plays down when working with an international ensemble?
How tokenism plays down in these kind of relations?

Creating a common culture (network music && live coding) can favour alliances between subaltern people without being separated by geography
