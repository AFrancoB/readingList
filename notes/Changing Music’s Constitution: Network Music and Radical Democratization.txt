Notes:

A review of radical democratic theories influenced by technological developments and nonhierarchical network structures allows us to analyze factors influencing hierarchical structure in music ensembles. Network music ensembles are uniquely positioned to deploy heterarchical technologies that enable them to address radical democratic concerns relating to communication structures and power distribution. This essay provides examples of current politically tinged explorations in network music and examines the room left for maneuvering in developing systems that consider the implication of data structures on sociopolitical hierarchy.
