Notes:


summary by Thomaso Venturinni 

A network image can be rendered for just about every aspect of day-to-day life for which data exist, including financial information, organizational data, mapping systems of every variety, social networks, and technical ecologies of all kinds. In her recent book, An Aesthesia of Networks: Conjunctive Experience in Art and Technology, Anna Munster discusses the issues that come along with these growing networks throughout our collective lives. In turn, she proposes an attempt to challenge the visual and conceptual habits that have made our representation of networks trivial and inconsequential.
