Notes:

The latent and unstable nature of networked performances,
where the delayed transmission and uncertain, unstable,
and compressed reception of transferred information de-
mands scoring conceptualizations that consider the loss of
the presence information traditionally expected by musi-
cians when performing together in a shared space and time.
The focus of this study is to develop electronic network-
aware responsive scoring techniques that consider the pri-
mary constraints of networked music performances: i.e.,
latency, uncertainty, multilocated, and digital. Using ma-
chine-learning techniques to investigate and enhance digi-
tally mediated presence technology, scoring possibilities
are discussed that promote the experience of performing
together while being remote from each otherâ€”connected
via a public network and subject to latency. This study also
looks at compositional and technical approaches to creat-
ing responsive scores for networked music performances
using analysis of transferred sound as a means to generate
and control metadata and symbolic notation.
