Notes:

The purpose of this study is to explore effective strategies for successful collective
improvisation in laptop orchestras. Collective music-making requires listening to
and interacting with others in order to create a cohesive performance. However,
musical expression also involves a sense of agency (Maus 1991; Levinson 2004), which
may be perceived most prominently when individuals take temporary creative
leadership roles and intentionally destabilize the sense of cohesion, either to
rejuvenate it or to catalyze change. In my experience teaching and directing the
Concordia Laptop Orchestra (CLOrk), I have observed that orchestra members learn
to be attentive to stabilization and cohesion and to apply those concepts to their
music-making relatively quickly, but that they have more difficulty learning and
applying destabilization and catalysis techniques. Through interviews and
questionnaires with CLOrk members, I have learned that the obstacles to taking
destabilizing actions while improvising may be technical (primarily monitoring
challenges), personal (ego depletion and attentional limits), and/or social (risks of peer
rejection, exclusion, and shame). CLOrk members proposed strategies to address
these challenges, including (1) arranging the orchestra in subgroups to improve audio
monitoring coherence and to reduce attentional load and (2) communicating regularly
about all relevant matters, including emotional and social obstacles in order to
promote a mindful environment of sharing and a safe space for trial and error in the
creative process.
