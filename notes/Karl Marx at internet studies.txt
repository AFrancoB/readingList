Abstract:

The task of this paper is to point out the relevance of Karl Marx for Internet Studies. Marxian  concepts  that  have  been  reflected  implicitly  or  explicitly  in  Internet  Studies  include: (1) dialectics; (2) capitalism; (3) commodity/commodification; (4) surplus value, exploitation, alienation, class; (5) globalization; (6) ideology/ideology critique; (7) art and aesthetics; (8) class struggle; (9) commons; (10) public sphere; (11) communism. The paper provides a literature overview for showing that, and how, Marxian concepts have been used in Internet Studies. Internet Studies to a certain extent analyse the Internet, economy  and  society  in  Marxist-inspired  studies  terms,  yet  do  not  acknowledge  the  connection  to  Marx  and  thus  seem  superficial  in  their  various  approaches  discussing  capitalism, exploitation and domination. We argue that it is time to actively remember that Marx is the founding figure of Critical Studies and that Marxian analyses are crucial for understanding the contemporary role of the Internet and the media in society
