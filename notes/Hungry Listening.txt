Notes:


Hungry listening names setller colonial forms of perception.
"It is a “civilizing” sensory paradigm that has been imposed
on Indigenous people who grew up within residential school, boarding
school, and day school systems; who were part of the sixties and seven-
ties scoop; who have been disenfranchised by the Indian Act and forced
migration; who grew up on-­rez and in urban centers. Practices of hun-
gry listening have been passed on intergenerationally through families,
and continue to be defied through culturally immersive learning envi-
ronments within Indigenous communities across the globe."


Proper chapter:

"In particular, this chapter examines formations of listening guided by settler and Indigenous positionality, and outlines 
strategies for resurgent and decolonial listening practices."


So it is all about listening positionalities.

One listening is "well" if you can either capture the musical form and content or the spoken and discursive content.

Hungry listening prioritises the capture of information over the "affective feel, timbre, touch, and tex-
ture of sound."

"Attending to affect alongside normative listening hab-
its and biases allows us to imagine (or audiate) otherwise—­to develop
strategies for different transformative politics of listening that are re-
surgent in their exploration of Indigenous epistemologies, foundations,
languages, and sensory logics; or, ones that are decolonial in their ability
to move us beyond settler listening fixations"

The "Tin Ear" of settler colonialism

Definition of settler:
"More and more frequently used by non-­
Indigenous Canadians since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
on the Indian Residential Schools, the term “settler” has become a form
of self-­identification for those who were not, historically, the first set-
tlers of the already occupied Indigenous lands now known as Canada
but nevertheless understand their complicity in ongoing colonial poli-
cies that continue to constrain Indigenous rights and resurgence."


Settler == certain awareness of inequities between indigenous and non-indigenous people.

So there is a graduation: queer settlers, immigrants, etc. All have different degrees of responsability and complicity "in the continued occupation of Indigenous territories."

But sometimes the graduation and the awareness of settlers can be non-performative:
"non-performative utterances don’t accomplish what they say they accomplish; they perform a cer-
tain righteousness in one’s support for the project of decolonization or
reconciliation without actualizing individual responsibility that moves
beyond mere commitment to change."


Narratocracy rules over what is valid speech/action or thought and reaffirms the governance of narratives  as a way to express ideas.

First the settler colonial narratocracy will be tackled first.

Listening itself as a form of settlement.


"the ways in which a particular group
of settlers—­missionaries, residential school staff, music teachers—­set
about to reform the Indigenous engagements with listening, through
the action of “settling” perception itself."

Settler sociaty changed the way indigenous people related nwith listening.

So we are not talking about the actual sound context transplanted from x to indigenous lands. It is about changing the percpetual habits and engagement of the indigenous people.

"Listening regimes imposed and implemented “fixed listening” strategies
that are part of a larger reorientation toward Western categorizations of
single-­sense engagement, as well as toward Western ontologies of music
located in aesthetic appreciation."

The continuation of such regimes is structural listening (for example)

"Unifying these listening practices is the “civilizing”
drive for selective attention that renders listening as a process of the ear
rather than of the body."

Selective attention, regimes of listening are the ones that allow you to hierarchically organise sound sources and sound phenomenon. Give them a structure.

Sound and song in western ontology is all about aesthetique experience, by contrast, indigenous song and sound can be functional: can provide legal and historic frameworks.

Indigenous song, in contrast, serves strikingly different functions, including
that of law and primary historical documentation. A striking example
of this clash between Western aesthetic and Indigenous “functional” on-
tologies of song is apparent in Delgamuukw v. the Queen (1985), a land
claim trial in which Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en sought jurisdiction over
their territories in northern British Columbia, Canada.

The trial is interesting:

The judge eqautes the song with a performance and implies that the indigenous person is trying to connect affectively with the judge, seduce him perhaps.

From the indigenous perspective:

"This is what the memorial song is. To bring your memory back into that territory."


The song contains memory. "Captures a time in our lives" but it does so via making someone else feel the affective movements of the song. 

(Robinson, 2020, p. 45)
"It functions as a primary legal and living docu-
ment with importance for conveying the embodied feeling of history
“to the past [thousands of years of] what’s happened in the territory.”"

Songs as more than aesthetic devices. Song as legal documents, as historical recounts, etc.

"Indigenous ontologies of song ask us to reorient what we think we
are listening to and how we go about our practices of listening with
responsibilities to listen differently, while also requiring us to examine
how we have become fixated—­how listening has in effect been “fixed”—­
in practices of aesthetic contemplation, as a pastime or entertainment,
and through its various affordances."

"This is to say they are history, teaching, law that take the form of song,
just as Western forms of law and history take the form of writing."

"Decolonizing musical practice involves
becoming no longer sure what LISTENING is"


Second chapter -------- Hungry Listening

"From a xwélmexw perspective, settler subjectivity emerges out of a
state of consumption"

The word for white person (settler) is: starving person in the author's language.

Starving literally and metaphorically since they needed gold.

It starts with gold, it continues through land. Interestingly:
"In the twentieth century the hunger has grown for Indigenous artistic practice."

"In classical and new music performance, by contrast, palatable
cultural expression has been privileged over explicitly political work;
friendly forms of coming together have been privileged over agonistic
forms of dialogue; and that which is recognizably Indigenous has been
privileged over the everyday or urban; and the aesthetic beauty of In-
digenous songs has been privileged over recognizing their ontological
difference—­as forms of law, medicine, and history—­to Western music."

Not only the less antagonistic and palatable appropiation of western classical music to indigenous songs but also the liberal narratives of the "indigenous lacking" that overcomes it.


In western classical musical narratives:
"the listener orients teleologically toward progression and resolution, just as hunger drives
toward satiation."

"Hungry listening is hungry for the felt confirmations of square pegs in square holes, for
the satisfactory fit as sound knowledge slides into its appropriate place."


Not only we can have a structural and in-depth atomised listening but also a listening oriented towards the feelings and the more functional aspects of listening derived from indigenous practices.

"I might listen as a respectful guest, and in ways that do not seek to extract and ap-
ply a particular Haudenosaunee or Anishinaabe listening practice, but
nonetheless listen in relation with their knowledge systems."

So how to listen in reltaion of other ways of listening without extrcting or re-signifying.

Thye listening that the autgor describes: "sustains a moment of heightened presence derived not only from the
content that compels me to consider my relations, but from the time,
rhythm, and repetition of the words themselves that connect me to a
sense of place that is not my own, and slows down the pace of listen-
ing to that which comes next."

The pace of listening realtes with the starving attitude of settler listening.

THIS: *********************************
"Hungry listening consumes without awareness of how the consumption acts in
relationship with those people, the lands, the waters who provide sus-
tenance. Moving beyond hungry listening toward anticolonial listening
practices requires that the “fevered” pace of consumption for knowledge
resources be placed aside in favor of new temporalities of wonder dis-­
oriented from antirelational and nonsituated settler colonial positions
of certainty."


^^Guest listening: entering into a sound territory. Listening gives entry to indigenous territory.

When someone enters a territory via song it should be acknowledge as "merely an incommensurability that needs to
be recognized".

** this is interesting, the impossibility to access the others frame of references.

(Robinson, 2020, p. 53)
"Listening is perhaps always a listen-
ing through, or in relation with land."

But territory is constituted through live experience.

The relationship with land (and the movements that come with it) was considered unproductive by settlers. So the settlers 'civilised' indigenous' perception by fixing its attention in ways they deemed productive.

Fixing Attention, Fixed Listening


**Fixing Indians’ attention**

Indigenous have 'wild, restless habits'

(religious) Hymns, often translated to indigenous languages, were a way to transform the attention of indigenous people.


"When Canada’s Indian Act prohibited the potlatch and winter dances from taking place
for sixty-­seven years, it was essentially the equivalent to banning books
that document law and history, and also lessened opportunities to ex-
ercise xwélalà:m, a heightened form of perception resulting in richly
detailed memory."

The residential schools came, with them the inability to go back to your community in your free time.

"The deprivation of kinship effected by the
schools was part of a new quotidian presence of absence, a systematic
subtraction of those everyday moments of singing, speaking, and touch
between parents (and grandparents) and their children, and between
siblings."

The new sensory regime was implanted with extreme violence as can be read from a survivor's testimony:

"“Everything now looks different than it did before
Indian residential schooling. The air smells different, the food tastes dif-
ferent, the sounds are different. And my outlook, my perspective on the
world has changed in every area of my life”"


** this is must relevant ****
"­“to tattoo authority on colonized bodies
via the ears,” as Mark M. Smith has written—­often took place through
“the sound of clock-­defined time”"

Bells marked the time to eat, sleep, wake up, etc. Bells mark when to seat, when to stand up. Listening became disciplinary

Towards listening to Redress

Palimpsests:  pay attention to the scriptio anterior.

To listen to the already erased:
"“[consist] of the multiple contexts and complicated networks
that precede, surround, and are brought into being by a song’s perfor-
mance. It would . . . allow us to listen to history itself. It would enable a
panacoustic politics of listening, with all the granularity and dynamism
that term implies”"

So basically... trying to listen the indiscernible and the absent.

An exmaple about listening to all the layers of sound that war produces. Yes, but the author adds new complexity to such excercise:

Listen as the perpetrator of war and as the victim. Listen in all the many positions that war offers to have the fuller picture.


“we might say that the task of the palimpsestuous listener
is to discern both the things that a recording encourages us to remem-
ber and the things it urges us to forget, the things that are insistently
audible and the things that have long been silenced”

***** This is very relevant:

"The foundation of critical listening
positionality requires becoming aware of normative listening orienta-
tions across a range of gendered and racial formations, and developing
self-­reflexivity around how these are guided by their own specific forms
of hunger, starvation, and drive toward knowledge fixity."


The dangers are cognitive overload in the one hand.

"what Daughtry proposes as a heightened listening mo-
bility through what he calls contrapuntal perception (hearing simulta-
neous contextual layers), I would reorient as a practice of oscillation
(moving between layers of positionality) that seeks not to apply other
critical listening positionalites but instead to find greater levels of rela-
tionship between the strata of positionality."

Moving between layers of positionality which seeks points of relationshio between positions.

Here it is key to observe with a lot of attention how music venues and formats work in favour of what the author has proposed. It is key to re-imagine the spaces of performance that already exist AND to imagine new ones.


One critique to palimpsest listening, that seems to be totalising:
"“Listening to the palimpsest” is an imagined activity, and thus
is not representative of any individual’s actual listening experience."

It is not possible to listen to all the layers at the same time.


"Like Daughtry’s conception of the
palimpsest’s layers as ghosts of the manuscript, a decolonial practice of
critical listening positionality actively seeks out (or allows itself) to be-
come haunted. Thinking materially from the situation of concert prac-
tice, we might even use such haunting as a very literal strategy for whis-
pered interventions to take place during inclusionary works, or between
their movements."

********************** important reflection here ******************************

"Thinking materially from the situation of concert prac-
tice, we might even use such haunting as a very literal strategy for whis-
pered interventions to take place during inclusionary works, or between
their movements. With advances in directional speaker technology that
allow sound to be heard only by individuals within a narrow “beam,” de-
colonial intervention within inclusionary music might then mean com-
posing a counterorchestra of whispers that enacts acoustic haunting. As
the aural equivalent of a spotlight, directional speakers make possible
individual address within audiences and a potentially insurgent form
of aural redress"

This sounds a lot like social networks. In which people is together but do not share the same experience since the mediation mechanisms favour individuation. An individualised experience of a concert sounds a lot something that neoliberal politics (or even worst, postneoliberal politics would favour and would exploit for their benefit)

This resonates with the Fraser's critique to feminism. Some aspects of hungry listening overlap in interest with neoliberal subjectivity. Awareness of this might be relevant for my project.


-- summary --

"So far we have considered forms of listening bias and habit that con-
stitute settler colonialism’s tin ear, how settler listeners might learn to
identify aspects of—and then improvise with—their listening position-
ality, and how listeners might be impelled to listen otherwise through
interventions in concert ritual, site, and format."

Resurgent and Sovereign Listening

How about indigenous listening?

"It is easier to point, gesture, and listen
toward such sovereign “things” that have a certain amount of stabili-
ty in their objecthood and that paradoxically allow for forms of exam-
ination and analysis that are atomizing and extractive."

So, taking a melody, an instrument and analyse it in order to decolonise it. This is not sufficient.

"Perception, in
contrast, remains much more ephemeral, and though there are various
ways to study forms of perception, no sustained engagement with re-
surgent perception has yet to be offered."

Listening needs to be re-oriented as well!!!

Many artists focus their sovereignity projects around artistic objects and creative processes. 

"Sovereign speech does not necessarily provoke specific forms
of sovereign listening."

"we must paradoxically engage a listening that does not reduce
what is heard to the knowable, that resists a multicultural categorization
of one cultural sound among many, that understands sound in its irre-
ducible alterity, and that moves beyond our recognition of normative
musical or performance protocols. Such listening would understand
that not all sound can be translated to equivalent analogies,"

xwlálàm, síwél

The practices we are talking about are not consumable.

"The desire for the familiarity of
Indigenous songs, music, or the recognizability of other elements such
as rhythm and instrumentation, is the demand that difference present
itself in a form that accommodates settler recognition."

(Robinson, 2020, pp. 68-69)
"IT IS THE DESIRE FOR frameworks of display that serve the colonial palate and satiate hunger
for content."

HUNGER for content. HUNGER. Capital is in communication. : Like the voracious hunger of xwelítem, museum
display of Indigenous belongings is similarly oriented to accumulation


Listening not as a pure phenomenon:

"This situation of listening in this particular environment cannot be separat-
ed into a purely aural experience of listening. Indeed, such a situation
shares much in common with larger principles of witnessing in the
work of Morin, the work our communities do in the longhouse, and as
we gather around various tables in our communities. Wilson cogently
describes the role of witnessing in community events and its connection
to listening"

"xwélalà:m (listening), as a shxwelméxwelh form of attention, is a prac-
tice decidedly opposed to hungry listening, which gathers and instru-
mentalizes content that is heard. Instead, xwélalà:m might better be un-
derstood as a practice of gathering that takes place in non-goal-oriented ways."

The kind of listening that is proposed: non-goal oriented, does not consumes the content and is not purely aural.

It is "to become anttentive to something"
