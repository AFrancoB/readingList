Notes:

Live coding is almost the antithesis of immediate physicalmusicianship, and yet, has attracted the attentions of a numberof computer-literate musicians, as well as the music-savvyprogrammers that might be more expected. It is within thecontext of live coding that I seek to explore the question ofpractising a contemporary digital musical instrument, which isoften raised as an aside but more rarely carried out in research(though see [12]). At what stage of expertise are the membersof the live coding movement, and what practice regimes mighthelp them to find their true potential?
