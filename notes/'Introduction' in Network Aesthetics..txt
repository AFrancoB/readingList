Abstract:

The term “network” is now applied to everything from the Internet to economic systems to terrorist groups. But the word’s ubiquity has also made it a cliché, a concept at once recognizable yet hard to explain. Network Aesthetics explores how popular culture mediates our experience with interconnected life.

Each chapter considers how popular media and artistic forms make sense of decentralized network metaphors and infrastructures. The first half of the book examines narratives from the 1990s and 2000s, including the novel Underworld, the film Syriana, and the television series The Wire, all of which play with network forms to promote reflection on domestic crisis and imperial decline in contemporary America. The second half turns to digital media that are interactive, nonlinear, and dependent on connected audiences in order to show how videogames such as Journey open up space for participatory and improvisational thought.

Network Aesthetics makes contributions to fields including literary criticism, digital studies, media theory, and American studies. It demonstrates that, in the early twenty-first century world, networks can be felt, inhabited, and, crucially, transformed.
