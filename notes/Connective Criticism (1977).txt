Notes:

Critical inquiry as a transdisciplinary node. Ciritical thinking is in decay, but designing a space of critical thinking might be a way out of that.

" “reforge the broken links between creation and knowledge, art andscience, myth and concept,” as Northrop Frye has exhorted us to do"


Critical inquiry is part of art making.

"It has a vital cultural function as the agent of speculationand change, pointing to future possibilities for the artist, perceiving new socialneeds, new sources of ideas, paths to awareness, and areas of interaction. Spec-ulative criticism acts as a springboard to further dimensions of creative work, trig-gering new behaviors and attitudes of mind."

Critique are always parcial!!!

Art is an open system.

"A Center for Critical Inquiry can serve to connect a diversity of disciplines, initiating probes and researches which mayfurther the understanding of art and its future possibilities."
