Notes:

"communication depends on not what is transmitted, butwhat happens to the person who receives it. And this is a very diªerent matterfrom “transmitting information.” "

Meaning is not information send and distributed among many.


Art is not in objects but in systems. Art is not merely representation.

This is horrible:

"As artists, we deal in uncertainty and ambiguity, discontinuity, flux and flow. Ourvalues are relativistic, our culture is pluralistic, and our images and forms areevanescent. If it is processes of interaction between human beings that createmeaning and consequently cultures, then those systems and processes that fa-cilitate and amplif y interaction are the ones that we shall employ in order formore richly diªerentiated cultures and meanings to emerge."


" Theprimary eªect of creative interaction within such networks is to render obso-lete the distinction in absolute terms between the artist and viewer as producerand consumer, respectively."

"There is a need, however, for artists, designers, architects,museum directors, educators, philosophers, scientists, technologists, and politi-cians throughout the world to work together to create cybernetic systems thatwill support new forms of art practice, new means of public access, and the in-volvement of a wider range of participants.
