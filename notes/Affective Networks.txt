Notes:

This article sets out the idea of affective networks as a constitutive feature of communicative capitalism. It explores the circulation of intensities in contemporary information and communication networks, arguing that this circulation should be theorized in terms of the psychoanalytic notion of the drive. The article includes critical engagements with theorists such as Guy Debord, Jacques Lacan, Tiziana Terranova, and Slavoj Zizek.

------------------------------------

Are bloggers inflicted to "the world?" Their "boring lives, their obsessive lives, etc. Bñlogging is harmful.

Bloggers amplify and intensify the circuits of communicative capitalism. 

""anxiety with jouissance, with the surplus enjoyment he designates as objet a.""

Anxiety about blogging, then, is anxiety about enjoyment.

Blaming our failure to enjoy on bloggers thus compensates us for our failure by promising that were it not for the bloggers we would enjoy

Bloggers and "us being caught" reading their half-formed thoughts is a way of deflecting failure. We fail to enjoy, to create, to build because the noise that blogging generates. 

Enjoyment is an object of desire. Being distracted with this noise keeps us from confronting our drives.

(Dean, 2010, p. 2)
"Desire is always a desire to desire, a desire that can never be filled, a desire for a jouissance that can never be attained.  In contrast, drive attains jouissance in the repetitive process of not reaching it. Failure (or the thwarting of the aim) provides its own sort of success.  If desire is like the path of an arrow, drive is like the course of the boomerang." 

Subjects can feel satisfaction only by making their drives circulate without actually achieving their aim.

Drive is a loop. Subjects get caught on it. 

""My concern in this essay is with a specific aspect of this stuckness, namely, the feedback loops, the circuits of drive, entrapping contemporary subjects""

Communicative capitalism acts as a circuit of drives. Contemporary communication == circulation of affect


"Communicative capitalism relies on networks that generate and amplify enjoyment." (Dean, 2010, p. 3)

Such affectuve attachment is nos sufficient to create communities.

"Affective networks produce feelings of community or what we might call ‘community without community’. They enable mediated relationships that take a variety of changing, uncertain, and interconnected forms as they feed back each upon the other in ways we can never fully account for or predict. So while relations in affective networks merge and diverge in ways resistant to formalization, the circulation of intensities leaves traces we might mark and follow: blog anxiety, mood flows on Twitter, military message intensification, irrational exuberance." (Dean, 2010, p. 4)

Twitter has become a fundamental system in communicative capitalism as it allows affection to circulate broadly.

""Differently put, because updates are aspects of a practice, singular moments among many such moments, they both contribute to an affective flow and mark divergences from it. Little moment-to-moment reports suggest the pattern of changes in one’s feelings about one’s life""


The idea that twitter reflected the "ambiance" of social bodies is challenged by the presence of bots and other kind of agents that occupy most of the space in twitter (85% of twits are emited from 5% of "users").

"We were sensing not just networked generated moods, not just the multiplication of the feedback effects of our tweets, but the directed channeling and amplification of some streams over and against others" (Dean, 2010, p.6)

Pretended neutrality of the media, perverse relation as it is there to become the means for other's enjoyment. Military go to the media an describe a situation, media is neutral, it is just a platform to give the story.


Multiplication of message forces. How you achieve this in the era of communicative capitalism?

"repetition exerts a force, a compulsion; repetition has effects independent of the meaning of what is repeated" (Dean, 2010, p. 7)


Repetition has an affective impact. The tension between meaning and affective impact is relevant to contemporary communication.

**Tactical appreciation for contemporary short attention span

Spreading, diversifying and intensifying the message -> Force!

Even when facts are corrected the no-meaning fictions keeps spreading through the affective network.

The signal and noise binary does not work: Terranova rightly eschews the binary of signal and noise, arguing instead for the turbulent materiality of communication wherein information as such relies on ‘distracted perception’

**Turbulent materiality of communication**

Content is undermined under communicative networks. The message matters less than the fact that it is taking place. The point is to allow circulation.

"Contemporary affective networks rely on the marking, adding, forwarding, and circulating of messages not because doing so ‘means’ something but simply to communicate." (Dean, 2010, p. 9)

Perception is always partial and incomplete. So the gaps in our perception are filled by desire. 

We configure perception by paying attention to some* aspects rather than others. This is a process that takes place voluntarily or involuntarily.

displacement of content by contributions and distracted perception are the two effective tools to enforce a message

About information:
"Under communicative capitalism, an excess of polls, surveys, and assessments circulates, undercutting not only the efficacy of any particular poll or survey but the conditions of possibility for knowledge and credibility as such. There is always another survey, done by another group or association, with whatever bias and whatever methodology, displacing whatever information one thought one had." (Dean, 2010, p. 10)

***** THIS ******
"Given Lacan’s association of montage with the drive and the repetitive jumping among heterogeneous elements, decomposition and recombination appear more as aspects of our capture in affective networks than as tactics of resistance." (Dean, 2010, p. 10)

This is a fundamental critique to repetition and remix culture and politics: the given fragments that are recombined are already and deliverately desgined for remixing. Repetition, coupled with distracted perception and circulaation of the no-meaning of affection, has no chance to pose any meaningful resistance.

Basically it contributes to the ever-circulating flow that enables communicative capitalism amplifying its intensity.

"What’s clear, is that far from a left-wing political application, montage is well-suited to a political Right, in both its neoliberal and its neoconservative guise, insofar as this Right thrives on uncertainty, insecurity, and turbulence as easing the flow of affective intensities and consolidating our capture in the networks of drive." (Dean, 2010, p. 11)

Dean analyses the dotcom buble of the 90s and the financial crash of 2008 claiming that the feedback loops of information played a key rol. To provide financial crisis information/mathematical systems were put in place. But when everybody acquired such system it became a substantial factor to take into consideration (which the system in itself did not). 

Guy Debord integrated spectacle society is a spectacle that, at the same time that it rebuilds society, it explains it. This self reflexivity is the most important claim by Debord. The notion that a system has to consider itself as part of its analysis.

Debord implies that the problem is that images are generated by someone else, thus free software and image production software is the sollution. 

"[...]then participatory technology is the solution. Anyone who makes her own images is a threat, a radical, a revolutionary. But this solution leaves out underlying questions of access and ownership, not to mention the fundamental trap of an ever-intensifying image environment as more and more of us upload videos to YouTube" (Dean, 2010, pp. 15-16)

Dean identifies the problem not in control, it is not the agents that control from top to bottom the production of images it is in circulation in itself. With facebook the first risk is what YOU upload to your facebook profile (compromising pictures, private info, location, etc)

Control is not the issue, the verticality is not what makes communicative capitalism so problematic.

"The lack of action is the abundance of discussion viewed from a different angle." (Dean, 2010, p. 16)

Debord claims that non-expert knowledge is resistant under mass media and control. But is it not the internet a space that has to be approached with the most carefull skepticism no matter what? Internet puts into question science, expert politicians, traditional knowledges, everything can be falsified in the internet!!!!


The internet is not a spectacle provided by/for state power/control. It is the spectacle that we have become and we provide to ourselves. 

"Networked, participatory spectacles let us stage and perform our own entrapment." (Dean, 2010, p. 17)

There is a recent turn to understand networks not only as protocological and infratsructure but as affective.

Networks have a significant affective dimension!

Dean claims that Hard & Negri provide a framework to understand affective labour as aq generator of social networks. They disattache the idea of the network from the technological infrastructure and the internet. Networks then are affective for Hardt and Negri.

Galloway claim that there is a tension “between unitary aggregation and anonymous distribution, between the intentionality and agency of individuals and groups on the one hand, and the uncanny, unhuman intentionality of the network as an ‘abstract’ whole.”


"My claim is that this uncanny intentionality is best understood via the psychoanalytic notion of drive. The loops and repetitions of the acephalous circuit of drive describe the movement of the networks of communicative capitalism, the ways its flows capture subjects, intensities, and aspirations" (Dean, 2010, p. 19)

Contemporary networks require our participation. We participate and extend the entwork everytime we loop in and we allow drive to circulate. "Our participation does not subvert communicative capitalism. It drives it"

A piece of information unleashed in cyberspace produces an excess which can be understood as affection. An affec that changes the topology of cyberspace itself. This surplus is affection (enjoyment) and it depends on circulation.

Images replicated through the internet carry a surplus of affection. It is not the image itself that matters. It is its excess.

Affect is not only movement. Is an opening towards the register of the virtual. An affection is a memory, experience or anything that throws the subjects beyond themselves. 

This excess, in the context of the itnernet, is not new meaning or perspective. But the intensity that repetition carries. It intesifies sameness. Thus, in this form of communication there is a displacement of meaning and intentionality in order to favour the repetition of the same.

The extra of repetition is enjoyment. 

The movement that drive generates is circular. Moving to get nowhere. This generates anxiety.

We reaffirm ourselves by enjoyment.

Summary:
To reiterate, the object of anxiety is surplus jouissance, designated by Lacan as objet petit a.  Copjec presents it in terms of a confrontation with an unrealized past as well as with the super-ego, a confrontation the subject attempts to flee by pursuing knowledge. Her account of anxiety corresponds to what Žižek (following Jacques-Alain Miller) designates as “constitutive anxiety,” that is “confrontation with objet petit a as constituted in its very loss,” that is, objet petit a as an object of drive.1 In both instances, the object is loss (rather than lost): the loss of an unknowable past (rather than a specific experience), the loss of a capacity to obey or comply (no matter what one does, one cannot satisfy the super-ego). The blockage or stuckness of anxiety, then, is at the same time the repetitive, circular movement of drive, the force of loss.

"It circulates and it circulation is an effect of its failure to anchor. Nothing can stop the progress of science; nothing can stop the movement of ideas. Information wants to be free—to circulate round and round. The more knowledge we accrue, the less we know. Abundance from one perspective is lack from another." (Dean, 2010, p. 23)

So we know more of the outside because we refuse to confront ourselves and know who we are. This is foundetiional for university research!! ****

Contra Hardt and Negri, networked communication is better understood via the negativity of drive, a negativity that results in stuckness and movement, rupture and creativity, a negativity, in other words, capable of accounting for the reflexivity in real networks (so, negativity here connotes positive feedback and the excess of an effect in relation to its cause)

So, the more we feed the affective networks in which we participate the less likely we are to actually producing political structures that are new and effective on possing a different world. Political networks are not possible insofar we encourage affective networks. The problem is that affective network is already captured. We need affective networks of uncaptured political difference.!!!******


"Failure, or what Elsaesser tags ‘constructive instability’, is functional for communicative capitalism; it’s our ensnarement in the loop of drive." (Dean, 2010, p. 25)

**At the end of the article, the paradox is that any contribution to the network exacerbates it. Any new piece of data becomes a new p'iece of information circulating in the netwrok that will prdouce enjoyment and satisfaction. Every new article will drive us in loops that isntead of allowing knowing oneselves allows for the extension of knowledge production that allows to displace the question of who one is even more and better.
