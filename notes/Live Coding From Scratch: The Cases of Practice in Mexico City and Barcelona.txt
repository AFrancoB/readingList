Notes:

Live coding performance starting from a white screen is commonly
termed from scratch. In this contribution, we present some thoughts
about the possibilities and consequences of this technique, based on
our experience as members of the live coding communities of Mexico
City and Barcelona. For that, we described from scratch rules and
definitions of each community and then, we comment on how this
practice began at each place. We finish the text discussing why we
consider that live coding from scratch is a technique whose practice
can be used as an epistemic tool, through which new creative spaces
and limits are explored.
